## LaunchPad WordPress Theme Framework

LaunchPad is a WordPress theme framework. We believe that theme development should be enjoyable. LaunchPad attempts to take the pain out of theme development by organizing and simplifying common tasks used in the majority of theme projects,
such as templating, theme settings, custom metaboxes, and ajax.

LaunchPad is simple to use, yet powerful, providing the tools needed for large, robust WordPress themes. LaunchPad is built to extend the power of the LifterLMS plugin to create elegant themes designed for learning management systems.
